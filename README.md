## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains all deliverables for the Short Story Assignment based on the research survey:

**“Evaluation and Benchmarking of LLM Agents: A Survey (KDD 2025)”**

The technical content of the survey was transformed into an accessible, human-centered short story delivered through:

- A **Medium.com article**
- A **SlideShare presentation**
- A **10–15 minute recorded video**
- This **GitHub repository** with all artifacts

## 📄 1. Medium Article

🔗 **Medium Article Link:**  
*<Insert Medium link here>*  

**Article Title:**  
*Can We Trust AI Agents? A Human-Centric Guide to Evaluating LLM Agents in 2025*

**Article Summary:**  
The article explains why agent evaluation is harder than traditional LLM evaluation, introduces the survey’s 2D taxonomy of evaluation objectives and processes, and highlights real-world challenges such as safety, reliability, compliance, memory, and planning. It includes my own analysis, insights, and visuals for better understanding.

## 🎞️ 2. SlideShare Presentation

🔗 **SlideShare Link:**  
*<Insert SlideShare link here>*  

A 15-slide deck summarizing:

- Motivation behind evaluating agents  
- 2D taxonomy (WHAT to evaluate & HOW to evaluate)  
- Agent behavior, capabilities, reliability, and safety  
- Evaluation tooling, metrics, and enterprise challenges  
- Key takeaways and future directions

## 📘 4. Paper Summary (Short Version)

The short story and materials are based on the survey’s key contributions:

### 🔹 1. Evaluation Objectives — WHAT to measure
- Agent Behavior (task success, quality, latency, cost)  
- Agent Capabilities (tool use, planning, memory, collaboration)  
- Reliability (consistency, robustness, error handling)  
- Safety & Alignment (fairness, toxicity, compliance, privacy)

### 🔹 2. Evaluation Process — HOW to evaluate
- Interaction Modes (static vs. dynamic evaluation)  
- Benchmarks & Datasets (web, tool-use, safety, reasoning)  
- Metrics (code-based, LLM-as-a-judge, human evaluation)  
- Evaluation Tooling (LangSmith, DeepEval, platforms)  
- Environments (sandbox, enterprise systems, simulations)

The survey highlights why evaluating agents is fundamentally harder than evaluating LLMs and why modern AI requires more rigorous safety, robustness, and multi-step assessment frameworks.

## 🔍 5. Additional Survey Papers Referenced (Optional)

If applicable, list any other surveys you referenced:

- LLM-as-a-Judge surveys  
- Agent safety and risk assessment surveys  
- Memory mechanisms in LLM agents  
- Multi-agent system surveys  

---

## 🗝️ 6. Key Takeaways

- Agents operate in dynamic environments, so evaluation must go beyond accuracy.  
- Reliability, safety, and compliance are critical for enterprise deployment.  
- AgentOps and evaluation tooling are becoming essential parts of the development cycle.  
- Holistic, realistic, and scalable evaluation frameworks are the future of agent assessment.
